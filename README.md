# designers-learn-to-code-example-sites

While at Vendasta, I gave lessons to designers who wanted to learn the basics of html, css coding. I created three simple designs and sites (only two available so far here) for the lessons.

Feel free to grab the code to use for your own **personal** sites. Not for resale or part of a paid service.
