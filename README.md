# designers-learn-to-code-example-sites

At Vendasta, I taught designers the basics of HTML and CSS. To support the lessons, I created three simple designs and websites (two of which are currently available here).

Feel free to use the code for your own personal projects, but please do not resell it or use it as part of a paid service.

Why is this an Angular app instead of a regular HTML page?
Good question! This app was used as a showcase for students, allowing them to view the code and try it out directly in the browser, which made the most sense for hands-on learning. Unfortunately, StackBlitz had some issues with native HTML and CSS serving during development. Since Vendasta primarily uses Angular, it was practical to create a quick Angular app to ensure reliable live reloading while working.
