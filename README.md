# designers-learn-to-code-example-sites

At Vendasta, I taught designers the basics of HTML and CSS. To support the lessons, I created three simple designs and websites (two of which are currently available here).

Feel free to use the code for your own personal projects, but please do not resell it or use it as part of a paid service.
